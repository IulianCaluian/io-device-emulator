# io-device-emulator
This repository contains a software implementation of an input-output (IO) device emulator. 

## Description
It can emulate a device with actionable outputs, relays, and inputs that can be controlled through a web API. The emulator will simulate the behavior of a real-world device and provide a convenient way to test and validate system integrations without having to use physical hardware.

## Features
* Emulation of outputs and relays
* Web API for controlling outputs and relays
* Input simulation
* User interface for manual control
